## Introduction

The Doctrine Extension Bundle enhances Doctrine ORM for Symfony applications by providing a set of powerful extensions.
These include automatic timestamp and user tracking, seamless UTC date handling, and a simple yet robust translation system for your entities.
Designed with performance and simplicity in mind, this bundle integrates easily into your project, helping you manage common entity behaviors with minimal configuration.
